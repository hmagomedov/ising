## Kawasaki Dynamics on the Square Ising Model

Sampling: Kawasaki dynamics spin exchange. Neighboring spins are exchanged with a probability inversely proportional to the total increase in energy in the system entailed by the exchange. If energy would decrease, spin exchange is automatic. 

Initial Conditions: 100x100 lattice, 80% negative spins, 20% positive. Positive spin boundary.

Rougly 2 billion iterations until formation of a stable connected Ising droplet.
