Sampling: Kawasaki dynamics spin exchange. Neighboring spins are exchanged with a probability proportional to the total decrease in energy in the system. If energy would increase, no spin exchange takes place.

Intial Conditions: 100x100 lattice, 80% negative spins, 20% positive. Positive spin boundary.

Rougly 2 billion iterations until stable connected Ising droplet.
