Sampling: Kawasaki dynamics spin exchange. Neighboring spins are exchanged with a probability proportional to the total decrease of energy in the system. No exchange if energy increases. 
Intial Conditions: 100x100 lattice, 80% negative spins, 20% positive. Positive spin boundary.
Rougly 2 billion iterations until stable connected Ising droplet.
